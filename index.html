             Cybersecurity workers protect our most important and private information, from bank accounts to sensitive military communications. However, there is a dangerous shortage of cybersecurity workers in the United States that puts our digital privacy and infrastructure at risk.</br></br>
             In 2016 there were 112,000 openings for Information Security Analysts, but only 96,870 workers currently employed in those positions – an annual talent shortfall of over 15,000 workers for cybersecurity’s largest job.</br></br>
             
          </div>
          <div class='aboutQuote col-md-6'>
            <p class='aboutTxt'>There are 200,000 additional openings requesting cybersecurity-related skills, and employers are struggling to find workers who possess them. Jobs requesting cloud security skills, for example, remain open 96 days on average – longer than any other IT skill.</p>
            To help close the cybersecurity skills gap, CyberSeek provides detailed, actionable data about supply and demand in the cybersecurity job market.
